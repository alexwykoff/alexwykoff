# Alex Wykoff - @alex_wykoff

:wave: Hi! I am Alex Wykoff, a product leader who is working on something cool, but always open to making new connections.

My prior work at :lion:Brave focused on <b>Rewards</b>, the in-browser cryptocurrency system.

If you're using Brave now, click on that triangle in the address bar. You'll see my Github account is verified! I drove that feature and many others.

If you'd like a recap on some of my achievements there, [check out my site](https://alexwykoff.com/).

:coffee: Wanna chat? :point_right: @ me on <a href="https://twitter.com/alex_wykoff">Twitter</a>
